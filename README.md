# Number Guessing Game üé≤

A CLI-based interactive number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## Features ‚ú®

- Randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
- Multiple difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: 10 chances
  - **Medium**: 5 chances
  - **Hard**: 3 chances
- Provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the target number is greater or less.
- Displays a congratulatory message when the user guesses correctly.
- Tracks the remaining attempts and ends the game when the user runs out of chances.
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The game starts with a welcome message and rules.
2. Users select a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: 10 attempts
   - **Medium**: 5 attempts
   - **Hard**: 3 attempts
3. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
4. Users input their guesses:
   - If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.

5. The game ends when:
   - The user guesses the correct number.
